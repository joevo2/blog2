Another day another "startup" but this time round, I'm not leading the charge. 

That day my BA/SCRUM master was sitting at the pantry. I went ahead and do what I should do instead of "running away". I did the hard thing, not the easy and ignorance nobody see me and run easy thing.  

I was new in the company, I should talk to people I said to myself, and I sat down. "Hey Nic", I said, then we proceed to talk about some general life stuff. Then he suddenly stroke me with, "Hey Joel, I have this idea...". Immediately I know where is this heading.
