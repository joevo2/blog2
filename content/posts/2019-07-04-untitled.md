What keeps you going? Motivation? Interest? Money? Responsibility? To me non of that seems to matter, as I'm able to figure my way around it and dive into the hole of abyss. Feeling yucky and disgusted by myself and the vicious cycle continue as I conduct one escape after the other. 

I figured out that if I'm dealing with human, I can talk my way out of doing x task. Be it submitting a work, deploy an app or washing the dishes. If is dealing with a system in let's say an organisation I would force myself to complete said task as it is not easy to game the system. Assignment due on x date have to be submitted on x date unless I'm able to convince the lecturer to postponed or change the date which is not an easy task.

Recently I had switched my job from a startup to a corporate and I've been having a pretty productive life until the end of the stories. 

What is stories you ask? In a SCRUM development team we have feature to be developed that are called stories. Stories usually encompass a few Acceptance Criteria such as User able to login. User will be presented with the dashboard after login. Dashboard screen consist of x item.
