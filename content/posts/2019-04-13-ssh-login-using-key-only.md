## Connect to remote server using local machine/client ssh key for authentication.

1. Generate SSH key using the command `ssh-keygen` in OS X and Linux terminal if is not already generated at `/.ssh`. Window user can use PuttyGen.
2. Copy client ssh key to remote machine authorized_key file\
   `cat \~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 â€œmkdir -p \~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
3. Edit remote machine `/etc/ssh/sshd_config PasswordAuthentication no RSAAuthentication yes PubkeyAuthentication yes`

## Bonus: Generate server private key for anywhere access using key only

1. Generate key on server `ssh-keygen`
2. Put the key into authorized_key file `echo \`cat \~/.ssh/uploaded_key.pub\` >> \~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
3. Copy key from machine to local machine using SCP `scp user@192.168.0.103:/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa ~/user/Desktop`
(Edit the username, IP address and folder accordingly)
5. Convert the `id_rsa` file to putty file for use in Putty
6. Connect using Putty
