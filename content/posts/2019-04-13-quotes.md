* Even if is out of your league doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try it. Don’t give yourself chances to imagine “what if?”
* Grip your hand and all you’re holding is yourself and some air, let go of your grip and you have the whole world in your hand.
* You don’t have to think about what things you like, just think of the things you don’t like and don’t do it 😊
