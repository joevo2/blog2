When your colleague is way more productive and focused. He even have a YouTube on with programming tutorial and in the mean time focusing on the task on hand. 

The shitty feeling you have persists yet you just cant get through it, no song, no coffee, no nothing can get you focussed. 

And you are way overdue for your current task on hand. 

LOL this is supposed to be a self branding blog. 

But I should be real as well. 

I am in need of a solution, why can't I just do it like I'm playing the sims or city skylines and do what is right and propel myself forward. 

Human being? Well other human are able to do so. Is not about Human is about you, yourself.
