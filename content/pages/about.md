I'm Joel Yek, a web and mobile app developer, speaker, workshop conductor, anime fan, and podcast listener living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾

I mainly develop web app using React and NodeJS, while mobile app development would be on React Native. On the side I do conduct some React Native workshop around Malaysia.
